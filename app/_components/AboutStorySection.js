          My journey into <span className="text-purple-700 ">web development</span> began out of curiosity. It started when I tried registering on an
          organization&apos;s website — the entire process felt
          <span className="text-purple-700 "> confusing</span> and <span className="text-purple-700 "> stressful</span>. Without any clear direction,
          navigating the site was almost impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          After coming across several websites with the same poor user experience, I began to wonder: Do developers really think about
          <span className="text-purple-700">users</span> when building these platforms? Not everyone is
          <span className="italic">tech-savvy</span>, and I believed websites should
          <span className="text-purple-700 "> guide users effortlessly</span>, not frustrate them.
        </p>

        <p>
          That thought became my <span className="text-purple-700">motivation</span>. I wanted to build websites that make digital interactions
          <span className="text-purple-700">simple</span>,<span className="text-purple-700"> clear</span>, and
          <span className="text-purple-700"> enjoyable</span>. I realized that design and functionality should always work hand in hand to serve
          <span className="italic"> real people</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then, I&apos;ve focused on learning and perfecting <span className="text-purple-700"> frontend development</span> — turning my
          curiosity into a mission to craft
          <span className="text-purple-700"> modern</span>,<span className="text-purple-700"> accessible</span>, and
          <span className="text-purple-700 "> performance-driven</span> web experiences that make users feel
          <span className="italic"> comfortable</span>,<span className="italic"> confident</span>, and <span className="italic"> in control</span>.
